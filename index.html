        <h1>Robots</h1>
        
        <p>
            A <strong>robot</strong> is a machine capable of of performing complex tasks autonomously (or semi-autonomously). In fact, the tasks that a robot performs will largely determine its overall shape and physical construction. The branch of engineering which deals with the design, construction, and programming of robots is called <strong>robotics</strong>. Although robotics itself is only a couple of decades old, the idea of programmable machines goes back to ancient times, with animated statues and automata, used primarily for entertainment.

            The term robot itself was first coined in a 1920 play by the Czech writer <strong>Karel Capek</strong>. Following the development of industrial processes robots were designed and built to automate otherwise dangerous or physically demanding tasks. The rising use of robotics in industry has rapidly displaced many blue-collar workers and has led to concern regarding the role that robotics may play in future economies.
